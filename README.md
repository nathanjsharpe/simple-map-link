So this one time I wanted a link from Google Maps. I didn't want to share it, email it, or anything. I just wanted the link. It was too hard for me to get it. This silly little project was the product of my frustration. It uses [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), and of course the Google Maps API.
